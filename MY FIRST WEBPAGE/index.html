    <h1>FATHER OF BOLLYWOOD- SRK!</h1>
    My favourite actor is Shahrukh Khan. He is one of the most versatile actor in Bollywood. He is a superstar and people know his as King Khan of Bollywood in the film industry. He is one of the most famous personalities in Asia and the richest actor in the world. He is very talented and good looking. Not only the youngest but old people also like his work.
    <br>
    <p>Shahrukh began his journey by landing the lead role of a commando in 1988 drama series "Fauji". He was much applauded for his work and soon became the heartthrob of teenage girls, bagging roles in other serials such as "Circus" and "Dil Dariya", the former was
        delayed because of various reasons. He also had a minor role in a made-for-television film called In
        Which Annie Gives It Those Ones.
